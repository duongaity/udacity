## Task 2: Calculate Infrastructure Costs

### Target a monthly estimate between $8,000-$10,000

Total Monthly: 8,021.71 USD


### Your budget has been reduced from $8,000-$10,000 to a maximum of $6,500

Total Monthly: 6,015.68 USD

Solution: We will choose the lower performance for EC2 Instance (r6g.4xlarge > m3.xlarge), and Amazon RDS for MySQL (m4.4xlarge > m2.xlarge)

### Your budget has been increased to $20,000

Total Monthly: 18,527.42 USD

Solution: We will choose the high performance for EC2 Instance (r6g.4xlarge > c5.12xlarge), and Amazon RDS for MySQL (m4.4xlarge > db.m5.4xlarge), and increase S3 Storage (2 TB > 10 TB).
