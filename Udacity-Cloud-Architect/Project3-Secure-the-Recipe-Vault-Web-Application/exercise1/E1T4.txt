Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

All the S3 buckets have no server-side encryption enabled.
Amazon S3 supports the HTTPS protocol, which encrypts data in transit to and from Amazon S3. 
We should enable default encryption on your bucket with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.


# Poor practice 2

WebAppSG, AppLoadBalancerSG, AttackInstanceSG defined as 0.0.0.0/0.
We should add rules that control the traffic based on protocols and port numbers,
sets of rules for inbound traffic and outbound traffic.
