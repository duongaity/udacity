# Udacity Cloud Architect

Project Overview

## Project 1: Recoverability In AWS

In this project you will create highly available solutions to common use cases. You will build a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and show how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions. You will also build a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.

## Project 2: Design, Provision and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale

In this project, you will plan, design, provision, and monitor infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. You will practice the skills you have learned throughout the course to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance. You will also use Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

## Project 3: Secure the Recipe Vault Web Application

In this project, you will:
- Deploy and assess a simple web application environmentâ€™s security posture
- Test the security of the environment by simulating attack scenarios and exploiting cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- Implement monitoring to identify insecure configurations and malicious activity
- Apply methods learned in the course to harden and secure the environment
- Design a DevSecOps pipeline
