# Udacity Cloud DevOps

Project Overview

## Project 1: Deploy Static Website on AWS

The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions to implement:
- Hosting a static website on S3 and
- Accessing the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. Recall that CloudFront offers low latency and high transfer speeds during website rendering.


## Project 2: Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation

As your final project, you'll be faced with a real scenario.

Creating this project will give you the hands-on experience you need to confidently talk about infrastructure as code. We have chosen a realistic scenario where you will deploy a dummy application (a sample JavaScript or HTML file) to the Apache Web Server running on an EC2 instance.

There will be two parts to this project:
- Diagram: You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.
- Script (Template and Parameters): The second part is to interpret the instructions and create a matching CloudFormation script.

## Project 3: Give Your Application Auto-Deploy Superpowers

In this project, you will prove your mastery of the following learning objectives (or sections):

- Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.
- Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.
- Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.

## Project 4: Operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API

In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API.

You are given a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on the data source site. This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, app.py—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

## Project 5: Capstone

In this project you will apply the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:
- Working in AWS
- Using Jenkins or Circle CI to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Building pipelines
- Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
- Building Kubernetes clusters
- Building Docker containers in pipelines
